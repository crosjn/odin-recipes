        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Fast microwaved oatmeal uses 10-minute oats cooked perfectly. By using bananas and spices, we omitted any processed sugars or sweetners. Our kids still LOVED this (and still do as teenagers!)</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups Oatmeal (10 minutes oats)</li>
            <li>2 Cups Water</li>
            <li>2 Cups Milk</li>
            <li>2 Bananas - browner is better!</li>
            <li>2 Tbsps Cinnamon (or more to taste)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a glass 4-cup measuring cup, add the water, milk, and oatmeal, stirring to combine.</li>
            <li>Microwave on full power for 4-1/2 minutes. You want it to just start boiling and need to watch it to be sure that it does, and does NOT boil over</li>
            <li>Stir contents and microwave on 50% power for 2 minutes. Again, you want it to boil but not boil over.</li>
            <li>Stir contents again, return to microwave and microwave on 20% power for 6 minutes. This is the equivalent of a stove-top simmer.</li>
            <li>Crush the banana to a pulp. Stir in the bananas and oatmeal</li>
            <li>Optional, dress with fresh berries to make a picture-perfect bowl!</li>
        </ol>
